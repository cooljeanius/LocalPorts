LocalPorts
==========

My local MacPorts repo for ports to submit to MacPorts

Instructions for Usage
======================

Just wait until the main MacPorts project commits them, if they haven't yet.
If you really can't wait, you can always clone this repo and then add it to your sources.conf file.

Port
====

I have a portfile pointing to this repo; the only reason for its existence is to install a bunch of dependencies.
