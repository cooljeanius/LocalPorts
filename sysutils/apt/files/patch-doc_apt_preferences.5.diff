 .PP
 Several versions of a package may be available for installation when the \fB\fIsources\&.list\fR\fR(5) file contains references to more than one distribution (for example, stable and testing)\&. APT assigns a priority to each version that is available\&. Subject to dependency constraints, \fBapt\-get\fR selects the version with the highest priority for installation\&. The APT preferences file overrides the priorities that APT assigns to package versions by default, thus giving the user control over which one is selected for installation\&.
