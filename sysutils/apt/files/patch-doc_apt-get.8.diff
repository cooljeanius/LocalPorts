-install is followed by one or more packages desired for installation\&.

Similarly a plus sign can be used to designate a package to install\&. These latter features may be used to override decisions made by apt\-get's conflict resolution system\&.

 A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by following the package name with an equals and the version of the package to select\&. This will cause that version to be located and selected for install\&. Alternatively a specific distribution can be selected by following the package name with a slash and the version of the distribution or the Archive name (stable, testing, unstable)\&.
