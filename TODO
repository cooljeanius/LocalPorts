# BROKEN PORTS
#
# The following ports are included in the current GNOME desktop
# environment specification and have been ported to MacPorts but
# are currently broken and/or need to be updated
#
# gnome-netstatus (builds but doesn't work -- tries to open /proc/net/dev)
# gnome-system-monitor (builds but segfaults on processes/resources -- probably due to lack of support for MacOSX in libgtop)
#

Make sure every GNU package has a port:

AMD has opensource stuff; the only one they confirm to work on Mac though is Aparapi

Things that don't exist on MacPorts, but that Homebrew and Fink use as dependencies for things that do also exist on MacPorts. For example:
- Homebrew's GDAL uses armadillo, but MacPorts doesn't have armadillo
- Homebrew's curl uses libmetalink, but MacPorts doesn't have libmetalink
- Homebrew's mysql uses pidof, but MacPorts doesn't have pidof

Projects I've forked on GitHub but haven't made ports for yet (or updated their existing ports):
- libmspack
- pict2pdf
- bap
